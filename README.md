# Data-Augmented-Explainable-AI-for-Pavement-Roughness-Prediction



Effective pavement management systems rely on accurate predictions of pavement condition to guide strategic decisions regarding the maintenance and rehabilitation projects. Although recent studies have explored various Artificial Intelligence-based methods for predicting pavement roughness, the literature still has notable gaps. Firstly, existing studies often rely on homogeneous data from similar conditions, such as climate and pavement type, across urban or rural settings. Secondly, they overlook the imbalance in historical data, especially the lack of higher-level International Roughness Index (IRI) values. Finally, many studies treat machine learning and deep learning models as black boxes, typically using static feature importance rankings that fail to capture the complex relationships between input features and predictive values. This study bridges these gaps by applying an explainable AI framework, enhanced with data augmentation, to a diverse and comprehensive dataset of pavement conditions. The proposed approach enhanced performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, reducing RMSE by 28.28%, RSR by 36.92%, and WMAP by 33.74%, while increasing R-squared by 7.28% and VAF by 6.61%. These improvements were particularly pronounced for higher IRI values and longer-horizon predictions. Explainable AI analysis provided practical insights, enhancing model applicability and supporting informed maintenance decisions.
